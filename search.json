    "text": "May 12-16 2025 [UTC] – Canberra, São Paulo, Buenoes Aires, Beijing, Hamburg, Tokyo, Oxford, Boulder, Princeton, Berkley\nThe Digital Earths Global Hackathon will bring together scientists from around the world to jointly analyze the first ever coordinated experiments of climate models simulating a full annual cycle with horizontal grid spacings of 5 km or less).\nParticipants will gather at one of a number of regional nodes for the hacking, each of which will provide access to a combined data-compute resource hosting the data and proximate computing capbility for its analysis. Each node will host at least one full annual cycle of output data standardized on a common (HEALPix) grid. Standardization will help participants share their analysis workflows with other teams analyzing other models at other nodes, and thereby build global communities around common interests.\n\n\nOfficial Global Hackathon website\nWCRP Announcement"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This data request is based on the Dyamond phase 3 protocol by Takasuka, D. et al. (2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main differences to the DYAMOND 3 data request\n\n\n\n\nWe request data on a hierarchy of HEALPix grids instead of 0.25 degree resolution.\nWe added snowfall_flux, liquid_water_content_of_surface_snow, snow_area_fraction_viewable_from_above, soil_liquid_water_content to the request.\nWe specify variable names.\nWe request most 2D fields only as 3-hourly means.\nWe specify that hourly 2D data should be instantaneous.\nWe remove “Downward LW radiation at the TOA”, as it is 0 anyways.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data from global models should be provided on the HEALPix grid on zoom level 10 (effective cell size of 6 km) or zoom 9 (13km). To ease analysis, please provide all HEALPix levels up to this level.\nFor regional models, we will need further discussion with teams that have a strong experience in intercomparisons of regional models.\n3D Output Levels:\nThe output should be interpolated to the following 25 pressure levels:\nimport numpy as np\ntr = np.arange(100,900,100)\nlt = np.arange(850,1025,25)\nua = np.arange(10,90,20)\nlevels = sorted({1,5,20,150,250,750}.union(tr,lt,ua))\n\n\n\nHEALPix grids have 12*4**level cells, so a level 9 HEALPix grid consists of roughly 3 million cells. It has proven very beneficial for the analysis to also store all lower grid resolutions. This adds approximately 30% to the output volume, and allows prototyping analyses at lower resolution, or generating maps from an amount of data that actually matches the pixels in a plot. For level 9 and all lower levels together, about 4 million floats are needed per 2D slice. Furthermore, we want the 2D fields on 6-hourly interval as well, and all fields also daily. The totals for storing this data (assuming 4 bytes/float, and 50% compression) are\n3D: 2.8TB\n2D: 1.7TB \ntotal: 4.5TB\nSee below for the code.\nWithout the hierarchy, the requirements are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\ncells / snapshot\nMB / snap-shot1\nsnapshots\nGB / var\nvars\nGB total\n\n\n\n\n2D\n3 M\n6\n365*24\n52\n33\n1650\n\n\n3D\n75 M\n150\n365*4\n220\n12\n2600\n\n\n\nNote that for any additional healpix level, the requirements grow by a factor of 4, so a ~6km resolution dataset (HEALPix level 10) already consumes about 20 TB.\n\n\n\nIn principle any file format that is compatible with standard software could be used. However, zarr has proven very advantageous, as it allows to\n\nbuild large datasets covering anything up to an entire simulation output\nchunk data in all dimensions\n\nIf plain zarr 2 is used, data can be read in many programming languages. For C-based software, a recent libnetcdf will do the trick. The downside of this approach is a lot of small files, which can be problematic on HPC systems, especially with inode quota.\nOther possible approaches include the use of kerchunk in python for grouping data chunks in (netCDF/HDF5) files into unified datasets that look like zarr to python. Other programming languages / codes can then still make use of the underlying netCDF files.\n\n\n\nFor some models, the hydrometeor categories may not map directly onto the specified output. In these cases hydrometeor habits can be left out (for instance if snow and cloud ice are not distinguished), or additional information can be added, e.g., for models with hail.

It has proven very beneficial for the analysis to also store all lower grid resolutions. This adds approximately 30% to the output volume, and allows prototyping analyses at lower resolution, or generating maps from an amount of data that actually matches the pixels in a plot. For level 9 and all lower levels together, about 4 million floats are needed per 2D slice. Furthermore, we want the 2D fields on 6-hourly interval as well, and all fields also daily.
