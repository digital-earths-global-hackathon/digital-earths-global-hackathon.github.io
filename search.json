    "text": "May 12-18 2025 – Beijing, Boulder, Oxford, Sao Paulo, Stockholm, Tokyo\nThe Digital Earths Global Hackathon will bring together scientists from around the world to jointly analyze the first ever coordinated experiments of climate models simulating a full annual cycle with horizontal grid spacings of 5 km or less).\nParticipants will gather at one of a number of regional nodes for the hacking, each of which will provide access to a combined data-compute resource hosting the data and proximate computing capbility for its analysis. Each node will host at least one full annual cycle of output data standardized on a common (HEALPix) grid. Standardization will help participants share their analysis workflows with other teams analyzing other models at other nodes, and thereby build global communities around common interests."

This could include output from km-scale regional models or km-scale satellite data all of which would ideally be standardized similarly to the global models. Likewise computing capabilities could be augmented to support the application of machine learning."

Also, we can check and see what different IT department could provide if something is not available at the venue from the start.\n\nvideo streaming for opening and closing sessions (?), keynotes(?)\nstable wifi connection in all rooms; the traffic isn’t too much, since the data is processed at the computing centers, but the connections should be stable\nenough power outlets in the group rooms\n\n\n\nCatering\nthis can be adjusted depending on our budget\n\nusually two coffee breaks per full day\nand lunch\nin Berlin and Vienna, dinners were included, only one dinner was included in Madrid, Hamburg and Wageningen\npossibly an ice breaker event on the first evening\nsome snacks (fruits, etc.) and beverages to be accessible also outside of coffee breaks were very well received",
