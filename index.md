**May 12-18 2025 -- Beijing, Boulder, Oxford, Sao Paulo, Hamburg, Tokyo**

The Digital Earths Global Hackathon will bring together scientists from around the world to jointly analyze the first ever coordinated experiments of climate models simulating a full annual cycle with horizontal grid spacings of 5 km or less).

Participants will gather at one of a number of regional nodes for the hacking, each of which will provide access to a combined data-compute resource hosting the data and proximate computing capbility for its analysis.  Each node will host at least one full annual cycle of output data standardized on a common (HEALPix) grid.  Standardization will help participants share their analysis workflows with other teams analyzing other models at other nodes, and thereby build global communities around common interests.
